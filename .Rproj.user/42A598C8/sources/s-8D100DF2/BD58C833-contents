#### Preamble ####
# Purpose: Now that the Data set has been cleaned and labelled by using the code provided by Alexander 
# and Caetano (Alexander Caetano 2020). The next step is to pull the information important to our analysis
# of Canadian women's decision making on the number of children they wish to have. This will be done by
# creating a subset of the total population that we neeed (women who filled out all the variables of interest)
# and by selecting and transforming all of the data in to more useful variables.
# Authors: Ben Draskovic

# Pre-reqs: You need to have run gss_cleaning-1.R from the associated git repository. 

#### Workspace Set Up ####
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)


#### Pull Data, select Important Variables, and Create Subset ####

    income_family,
    occupation,
    education,
    partner_education,
    partner_sex,
    region,
    pop_center,
  )

  subset(sex == "Female") %>%   #removes all male respondants a total of 9399
